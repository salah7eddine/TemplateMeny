					<h1>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.</h1><br>
					Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Well, then good news! It's a suppository.<br>

					With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!<br>

					Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?<br>
					And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. File not found. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. I'm a thing.<br><br>

					I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!<br>
					I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!<br>
					I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.<br>
					Negative, bossy meat creature!<br>
					You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Your best is an idiot! Soothe us with sweet lies. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?<br><br>

					I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!<br>
					Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!<br>
					A sexy mistake.<br>
					Do a flip! A true inspiration for the children. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Is the Space Pope reptilian!?<br><br>

					I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Daylight and everything. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.<br><br>

					Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Is that a cooking show? You're going to do his laundry? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!<br><br>

					Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.<br><br>

					And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. No! Don't jump! They're like sex, except I'm having them! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.<br><br>

					Bender, quit destroying the universe! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. We're also Santa Claus! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.<br><br>

					It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?<br><br>

					Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Why would a robot need to drink? Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.<br><br>

					I love you, buddy! Your best is an idiot! And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.<br><br>

					There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.<br><br>

					Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Okay, I like a challenge. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.<br><br>
